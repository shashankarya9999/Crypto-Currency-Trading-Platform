# Crypto-Currency-Trading-Platform

A console-based Cryptocurrency trading platform simulating the experience of buying and selling cryptocurrencies. The program works with a real data set representing order book of a real currency exchange platform.
<!--
Order book data
It is a CSV file containing the data retrieved from an actual exchange which happened in 2020. Each line in this file is an order in the order book. It represents people offering to buy things and people offering to sell things.
- Ask is when someone's offering to sell something.
- Let's say in row 61, the person has got 0.401 Ethereum for sale and he/she will sell it at a cost of 0.021 Bitcoin.
- Bid is when someone's offering to buy something
- Let's say in row 2, the person is offering to buy upto 7.44 Ethereum at a cost of 0.021 Bitcoin.

The idea of the platform is that it has got people offering to sell at this price and people offering to buy at this price and the job of the exchange is to remember all of that data, and then when the bids come in and the ask come in, put them together so that a trade happens. This is the most basic idea of an order book.
